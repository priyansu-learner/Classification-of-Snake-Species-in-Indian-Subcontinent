# SAAP: A Study on Deep Learning Based Models for Indian Subcontinental Snakes Species Classification 

This repository contains all the files used in the concerned research. The aim of the classification problem is to classify the species of a snake from its given image.
The dataset which we used here is collected from [Kaggle-SNAKECLEF2022 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/snakeclef2022).

Our main focus is on the Indian subcontinent which includes **INDIA,BANGLADESH,BHUTAN,MALDIVES,NEPAL,PAKISTAN AND SRILANKA**. 
We have also narrowed down the Snake species to the most deadly snakes of four categories i.e. **NAJA NAJA, BUNGARUS CAERULES, DABOIA RUSSELII, ECHIS CARINATUS**.

Here We follow *four* major methodologies.
- Vision Transfer through Hugging Face
- Resnest101 Model through Pytorch
- Transfer Learning Models
- Ensemble Method
