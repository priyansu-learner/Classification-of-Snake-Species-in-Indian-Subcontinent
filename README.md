# Deep Learning Based Classification of the Big Four Snake Species Using Visual Features

This repository contains all the files used in the concerned research. The classification problem aims to classify the species of a big four snake species from its given image.


## Dataset
The dataset which we used here is collected from [SNAKECLEF2022 Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/snakeclef2022).

Our main focus is on the Indian subcontinent which includes **INDIA,BANGLADESH,BHUTAN,MALDIVES,NEPAL,PAKISTAN AND SRILANKA**. 
We have also narrowed down the Snake species to the most deadly snakes of four categories i.e. **NAJA NAJA, BUNGARUS CAERULES, DABOIA RUSSELII, ECHIS CARINATUS**.

Here We follow *four* major methodologies.
- Vision Transfer through Hugging Face
- Resnest101 Model through Pytorch
- Transfer Learning Models
- Ensemble Method
